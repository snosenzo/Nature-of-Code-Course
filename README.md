# Nature-of-Code-Course
Over the summer I read Daniel Shiffman's Nature of Code and programmed along with it. These are the exercises that I did for it. Not all of them are fully comprehensive or commented. Most of them use at least some of the author's code/layout, but these are the independent challenges to apply concepts.
